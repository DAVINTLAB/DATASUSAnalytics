================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

EXECUTION ACCURACY (EX): 87.2%
   - Correct results: 41/47 queries
   - Primary metric indicating agent performance

COMPONENT MATCHING (CM): 63.5%
   - Structural similarity to ground truth
   - Indicates semantic understanding despite syntactic variations

EXACT MATCH (EM): 12.8%
   - Syntactic match with ground truth
   - Low EM with high EX indicates alternative valid SQL formulations

ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:
  - High execution accuracy (87.2%) demonstrates correct result generation
  - Perfect performance on EASY queries (100% EX)
  - Strong overall success rate (92.2%)
  - Low failure rate (7.8%) across all difficulty levels

LIMITATIONS:
  - HARD query execution accuracy (66.7%) requires improvement
  - Low exact match (12.8%) reflects syntactic variations
  - Component matching (63.5%) indicates structural differences
  - Complex mortality calculations remain challenging

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Enhance system prompts for complex JOIN operations
  2. Improve mortality rate calculation guidelines
  3. Analyze EX=1, EM=0 cases for alternative valid formulations
  4. Add Tier 2 validations for complex query patterns
  5. Document systematic error patterns in HARD queries
